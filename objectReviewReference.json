The pacing and balance of the different storylines and relationships lack better control. The fight sequences have good moments, but some abrupt cuts take away some of the dazzle. And finally, 3D animation proves to be a massive decline in almost every aspect compared to the ideal mix used in recent content.\r\n\r\nIt's a pleasant, light, fun adventure but sadly unfulfilling.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
